The Importance of Search Engine Optimization

SEO - Search Engine Optimization - is a method of improving your websites presence and appearance in web-browser search results. This means that, when applied correctly, your website is more likely to be found when someone types in a search to a web-browser, like Google or Yahoo.

One method of SEO is to use "meta" tags in the head-section of your page document that contain key information about your website. The "description" meta-tag holds a description of your website and will be immediately seen when your website is revealed as the result of a search. The "keywords" meta-tag holds keywords related to the content of your website. These keywords are crawled by web browsers when a search is performed and, if matched against your site, will bump your website up to the top of the results.

This can greatly improve the likelyhood that someone will reach your website when searching the internet for a particular service or product.

Other methods of SEO include using friendly URLs, sitemaps and images.
